# JungleTop - The Wild Top Type Application with a Flavour of JavaScript

## About
This project is about pushing the boundaries of what a top type application can be, and how to do it.
With a flavour of JavaScript, we'll aim to make it both interactive and accessible, due to the nature
of JavaScript, it should run on anything that has a web browser.

## Features
* A top type application with a flavour of JavaScript
* Lots of customizable elements
* A slick look and feel due to the use of CSS/LESS/SASS and *MORE*
* Cross-compatible with all major operating systems and browsers
* ( Hopefully ) A local server that you can run on your own computer and access it from anywhere,
  even on a mobile device!
